# 🧠 ANARIX AI Agent (FastAPI + Gemini + MySQL)

An intelligent AI-powered agent designed to interpret natural language questions, automatically generate SQL queries, execute them on a MySQL database, and optionally display visualizations — all through a user-friendly FastAPI interface.

It leverages **Google Gemini** (via Generative AI API) for robust natural language understanding and **Matplotlib** for insightful data visualizations on your e-commerce sales, ads, and eligibility metrics.
